# Burger App
| Created by Danielle Neubauer, UC Berkeley Coding BootCamp 2019/20 - 

## What is this app?
In this app you can add the type of burger you'd like to order in the search engine, add it to the list of "ready to be devoured" and then devour it by clicking "Devour" or delete it from the list by clicking "Delete". The burgers added to the list are added to the MySQL database and deleted from it when "Delete" is clicked.  

## This is what it looks like:
